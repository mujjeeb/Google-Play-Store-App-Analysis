# Comprehensive Analysis of the Android App Market

This Python project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing thousands of apps in the Google Play Store. The project utilizes the Pandas and Plotly Express libraries to clean, visualize, and analyze data. The data used in this project was scraped from the Google Play Store by Lavanya Gupta in 2018 and is available at [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore various aspects of the Google Play Store app market, including:

1. Identifying the highest-rated apps.
2. Finding the largest apps in terms of size.
3. Analyzing apps with the most reviews.
4. Examining the number of installs.
5. Identifying the most expensive apps.
6. Estimating the revenue of apps.
7. Analyzing app categories.
8. Calculating the median price of a paid app.

The project aims to provide insights into the category, size, and pricing strategies of apps in the Google Play Store.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The programming language used for the project.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/): A library for creating interactive data visualizations.

You can install Pandas and Plotly Express using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install plotly-express
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/android-app-market-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd android-app-market-analysis
   ```

3. Download the dataset from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and save it as `googleplaystore.csv` in the project directory.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to start the analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```


## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```

├── README.md                       # Project README file
```

## Data Cleaning

The project begins with data cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis. Missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data are addressed during this phase.

## Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes visualizations using Plotly Express to provide insights into the Android app market. Various aspects such as app ratings, size, reviews, installs, pricing, and categories are explored and presented in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
